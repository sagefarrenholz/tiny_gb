Important:
1| Create debugger that allows stepping and shows program state
2| Implement graphics
	Rip a background and sprite from a rom to use for testing

3| Add unit testing for each opcode / ability to individually test instructions
4| Implement cpu timings (currently going as fast as it can)
5| Determine correct intial state (ime, registers, etc)
6| Fix zero_reset on rot and shift ops
7| Add 16 cycle timings (hl) for prefixed opcodes
8| Fix bitwise operation coincidence bit
9| Implement di, stop, halt
10| Interrupts
11| Sound
12| Config file

Not as important:
1| Clean up code
2| General optimizations / Code review
3| Structure the repo
4| Prettify todo
5| Refactor repo

Future Goals:
1| Add in ability to switch palettes
2| Online Multiplayer
3| Switch to pure OpenGL? Vulkan?
